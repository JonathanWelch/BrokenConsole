#  Introduction
This code repository includes a solution with two console application projects.

I will be using it in a workshop to Graduates and Interns at my organisation to teach them how to debug in Visual Studio.

Here is more detail on each console application

##  01 - Debugging
This console application throws an exception when it is run.  The aim is to debug the application to find the bug.

##  02 - Breakpoints
This console application is to be used to test advanced skills of setting breakpoints.

Before carrying out the test you will need to set this project as the Start Up Project in the solution.

Set a Conditional breakpoint for the following scenarios:

1. When PrintOrder() is executed for Order 2
2. When PrintOrder() is executed for customers with first name Jack (tip: you can use the Contains() method
3. When PrintOrder() is executed for the third time

Set a Action on a breakpoint for the following scenario:

1. When PrintOrder() is executed output each Order Number
